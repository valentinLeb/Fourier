In this repository are contained the source code solutions to the Laboratories of the course “Computer Vision” of the Politecnico di Torino.
There are 7 Java projects, 6 of them uses JavaFX.
These projects were developed with the Eclipse IDE and they use the OpenCV Library for Java.
They come along with a set of tutorials, one for each project. You can find them at: http://polito-java-opencv-tutorials.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html.

In order to use these projects you are going to need to:
- download and install Ecplipse at: https://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php;
- download and install Java Fx (follow the procedure) at: http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#fortheambitious;
- download and install Scene Builder (optional) at: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/tools/index.html;
- download and install the OpenCV library at: http://opencv.org/;
